ItemThreshold
=============

Item Drop Threshold Plugin for TShock. 
Has no permissions, commands, or config. 
Threshold is constant for now, it is nearly impossible to hit current threshold on legit client.

Adds a threshold for dropping items
Should stop the hackers who "rain" items out of thin air.

Plugin doesn't have any commands / permissions.
Will force-kick the player upon reaching threshold.
Threshold is set to 6 by default, can be changed in config.
Well, you can reach threshold by opening multiple Goodie Bags really quick, but that isn't good either, is it?
